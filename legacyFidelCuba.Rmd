There have been lots of dicussion and debate on social media on the legacy of Fidel Castro since his death on November 25, 2016. Major focus  was on Cuba's exemplary achievement in health indicators during Castro's regime.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to dig into data and trace Castro's legacy through some numbers. 

These World Bank published WDI indicators data are available from 1960, right about the time Fidel got into power ousting Batista government. Therefore, this particular data set synchronizes pretty well with Castro's long run in the stint. 

Since we are talking about health sector, let's have a look at the motion chart relating life expectancy with mortality rate, two primary indicators of health situation in a country.

```{r,results='asis',tidy=FALSE}
load("./RDATA/latin.RData")
LE_MR<- gvisMotionChart(latin,
                      idvar="country", timevar="year",
                      xvar="life_expectancy",yvar="Mortality_Rate",
                      colorvar="iso2c", sizevar="population",
                      options=list(width=640,
                                   #state=myState,
                                   height=420))
## Display the chart in the browser
plot(LE_MR)
```

In the above chart, we find that even in 1963, Cuba had the lowest mortality rate among all the South American countries. In life expectancy, Cuba was only below Uruguay. Cuba kept up this strong initial condition of Castro regime until the end. 


To have better perspective of above phenomenon, we dig a little deeper into the above two health indicators. Let's start with life expectancy data. 

# Life Expectancy

This was Cuba in 1963:

```{r,results='asis'}
load("./RDATA/latin.RData")
latin %>%
  filter(year==1960) %>%
  arrange(desc(life_expectancy)) %>%
  select(Country=country,"Life Expectancy"=life_expectancy) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  xtable(caption='Table 1: Top countries in 1960 (Life Expectancy)') %>% 
                      print(type = 'html',
                            include.rownames = F,
                            caption.placement='top')
```

....and this is in 2014

```{r,results='asis'}
latin %>%
  filter(year==2014) %>%
  arrange(desc(life_expectancy)) %>%
  select(Country=country,"Life Expectancy"=life_expectancy) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  xtable(caption='Table 2: Top countries in 2014 (Life Expectancy)') %>% 
                      print(type = 'html',
                            include.rownames = F,
                            caption.placement='top')
```
# Mortality Rate

This was Cuba in 1963:

```{r,results='asis'}
load("./RDATA/latin.RData")
latin %>%
  filter(year==1963) %>%
  arrange(Mortality_Rate) %>%
  select(Country=country,"Mortality Rate"=Mortality_Rate) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  xtable(caption='Table 3: Top countries in 1963 (Mortality Rate)') %>% 
                      print(type = 'html',
                            include.rownames = F,
                            caption.placement='top')
```

....and this is in 2014

```{r,results='asis'}
latin %>%
  filter(year==2014) %>%
  arrange(Mortality_Rate) %>%
  select(Country=country,"Mortality Rate"=Mortality_Rate) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  xtable(caption='Table 4: Top countries in 2014 (Mortality Rate)') %>% 
                      print(type = 'html',
                            include.rownames = F,
                            caption.placement='top')
```



The above  tables reconfirm our findings on the dominance of Cuba as we have observed in  the motion chart at the very beginning. 

In the we have observed the beginning and the end but its also worth  checking Castro's regime in the middle. 

Now let's find the rank of Cuba in terms of life expectancy throughtout the whole regime of Castro.

```{r}
le_rank <- latin %>%
  select(country,year,life_expectancy) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(rank=min_rank(desc(life_expectancy))) %>%
  filter(country=="Cuba")

ggplot(le_rank,aes(x=year,y=rank)) + geom_point() + ylim(c(0,10))
```

We find that in terms of <strong> life expectancy </strong>, Cuba never have fallen below the rank of 6 among the 41 countries in this region in last 55 years. 

```{r}
mr_rank <- latin %>%
  select(country,year,Mortality_Rate) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(rank=min_rank(Mortality_Rate)) %>%
  filter(country=="Cuba")

ggplot(mr_rank,aes(x=year,y=rank)) + geom_point() + ylim(c(0,10))
```

We find that in terms of mortality rate, Cuba's rank through out the Castro regime  was even more impressive as it was in case of life exectancy. 

# South Asia and Cuba

Now let's try to compare South Asia with Cuba. In South Asia, Sri Lanka leads in terms of health indicator but Cuba beats Sri Lanka by a large margin. Over the years, South Asia tried its best to catch up but Cuba is still going strong.

<span class="stext2">Please be patient, it takes few seconds to load the motion chart </span>

```{r,results='asis'}
load("./RDATA/sa_cuba.RData")
LE_MR_sa_cuba<- gvisMotionChart(sa_cuba,
                      idvar="country", timevar="year",
                      xvar="life_expectancy",yvar="Mortality_Rate",
                      colorvar="iso2c", sizevar="population",
                      options=list(width=640,
                                   #state=myState,
                                   height=420))
## Display the chart in the browser
plot(LE_MR_sa_cuba)
```

As mentioned above, we find that Cuba is leading the South Asia fair and square but it's great to see the run of Bangladesh in catching up with Cuba beating most of the South Asian countries.


Back to Cuba and Castro. We can say that the country which Castro rules was in pretty good shape in  health indicators from the outset. Impressive aspect about Castro's regime was that he was able to maintain this robust achievement which enables Cuba to lead the region in health indicators.
